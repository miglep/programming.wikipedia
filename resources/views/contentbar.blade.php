    <h4>Definitions</h4>
   <p>A programming language is a notation for writing programs, which are specifications of a computation or algorithm.[3] Some, but not all, authors restrict the term programming language to those languages that can express all possible algorithms.[3][4] Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language.</p>
   <p>The increased use of <b>high-level languages </b>introduced a requirement for <b>low-level programming languages</b> or system programming languages. These languages, to varying degrees, provide facilities between assembly languages and high-level languages and can be used to perform tasks which require direct access to hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures and error-checking.</p>

<div class="History"><a  name="history"></a>
    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>The earliest computers were often programmed without the help of a programming language, by writing programs in absolute machine language. The <em>next step was development of so-called second-generation programming languages (2GL)</em> or assembly languages, which were still closely tied to the instruction set architecture of the specific computer. These served to make the program much more human-readable and relieved the programmer of tedious and error-prone address calculations. </p>
    <p>The first <em>high-level programming languages, or third-generation programming languages (3GL)</em>, were written in the 1950s. An early high-level programming language to be designed for a computer was Plankalk√ºl, developed for the German Z3 by Konrad Zuse between 1943 and 1945. However, it was not implemented until 1998 and 2000.</p>
   <p>The 1980s were years of relative consolidation. C++ combined object-oriented and systems programming. The United States government standardized Ada, a systems programming language derived from Pascal and intended for use by defense contractors. In Japan and elsewhere, vast sums were spent investigating so-called "fifth generation" languages that incorporated logic programming constructs.[41] The functional languages community moved to standardize ML and Lisp. Rather than inventing new paradigms, all of these movements elaborated upon the ideas invented in the previous decades.</p>

<div class="Syntax"><a  name="syntax"></a>
    <h4>Syntax</h4>
    <p>A programming language's surface form is known as its syntax. Most programming languages are purely textual; they use sequences of text including words, numbers, and punctuation, much like written natural languages. On the other hand, there are some programming languages which are more graphical in nature, using visual relationships between symbols to specify a program.The syntax of a language describes the possible combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation). Since most languages are textual, this article discusses textual syntax.</p>

<div class="usage"><a  name="usage"></a>
    <h4>Usage</h4>
    <p>A programming language provides a structured mechanism for defining pieces of data, and the operations or transformations that may be carried out automatically on that data. A programmer uses the abstractions present in the language to represent the concepts involved in a computation. These concepts are represented as a collection of the simplest elements available (called primitives).[64] Programming is the process by which programmers combine these primitives to compose new programs, or adapt existing ones to new uses or a changing environment. Programs for a computer might be executed in a batch process without human interaction, or a user might type commands in an interactive session of an interpreter. In this case the "commands" are simply programs, whose execution is chained together. When a language can run its commands through an interpreter (such as a Unix shell or other command-line interface), without compiling, it is called a scripting language</p>
    <p>In broad strokes, programming languages divide into <em>programming paradigms and a classification by intended domain of use</em>, with general-purpose programming languages distinguished from <em>domain-specific programming languages</em>. Traditionally, programming languages have been regarded as describing computation in terms of imperative sentences, i.e. issuing commands. These are generally called <em>imperative programming languages</em>. A great deal of research in programming languages has been aimed at blurring the distinction between a program as a set of instructions and a program as an assertion about the desired answer, which is the main feature of declarative programming. More refined paradigms include <b>procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, and logic programming</b>; some languages are hybrids of paradigms or multi-paradigmatic. An assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture. By purpose, programming languages might be considered general purpose, <em>system programming languages, scripting languages, domain-specific languages, or concurrent/distributed languages (or a combination of these)</em>. Some general purpose languages were designed largely with educational goals.</p>
